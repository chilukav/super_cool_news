The IMF is losing influence – and for that it must share the blame
<p>As politics turns ever inwards, the Fund must be quicker to admit its mistakes and implement reforms</p><p>This year, I didn’t attend the October annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington. Instead, I paid close attention to reports of the gathering and talked to people who were there whom I respect. What emerged is depressing for the wellbeing of the global economy. In particular, the prospect of continued weakness and fragmentation pressures will compound the challenges to the credibility and effectiveness of multilateral institutions.</p><p>The convening power of the IMF and the World Bank is unquestionably strong, if not unique. Every year, their annual meetings attract top economic and financial officials from more than 180 countries, as well as a far larger number of private-sector representatives. It’s an exceptional global gathering, not only for officials to exchange views but also for corporate networking.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/03/does-the-imf-need-to-refocus-its-role-after-the-argentina-crisis">Does the IMF need to refocus its role after the Argentina crisis?</a> </p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/03/does-the-imf-need-to-refocus-its-role-after-the-argentina-crisis">Does the IMF need to refocus its role after the Argentina crisis?</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/20/how-the-imf-can-stay-relevant">Continue reading...</a>

The Guardian view on political turbulence in Germany: can the centre hold? | Editorial
<p>The country’s traditional powerhouses on the centre-left and the centre-right face a moment of reckoning</p><p>Postwar German politics has a reputation for being moderate, consensual and a touch on the dull side. But there have been moments of high drama. In November 1959, for example, the Social Democratic party (SPD) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godesberg_Program" title="">abandoned its historic ambition to replace capitalism with socialism</a>, dropped the Marxist account of class struggle and began to pitch itself as a broad-based <em>Volkspartei</em> (people’s party). History vindicated the decision. For the next 50 years or so, the SPD vied for power with the country’s other great political force, the CDU (and its CSU Bavarian ally), as both parties regularly achieved a vote share of over 40%.</p><p>Famed for their practice of big-tent politics, what the CDU and SPD would give for such numbers now. The agonies of Brexit and the rise of rightwing populism have claimed the political limelight around Europe. But those looking for clues to the continent’s future would do well to watch Germany closely over the coming weeks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/17/the-guardian-view-on-political-turbulence-in-germany-can-the-centre-hold">Continue reading...</a>

The Guardian view on the NHS and the election: money talks | Editorial
The health service is in crisis and Tory cuts are to blame. But bigger budgets are not the only answer<p>The health service is a big issue in any UK election. There are two main reasons why, this time round, the arguments are particularly fraught. One is the sense of crisis engulfing the system after a decade of cuts, with A&amp;E waiting times in England the worst on record, and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/03/nhs-staff-quitting-due-to-burnout-and-bullying-report-says" title="">shortage of 100,000 staff</a> (in a workforce of 1.3 million) predicted by experts to grow to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/15/nhs-could-be-short-of-350000-staff-by-2030" title="">350,000 by 2030</a>. Allied to this is a consensus that many of the long-term challenges faced by the system are simply not being addressed. These include the overhaul of social care, which is universally acknowledged to be necessary but apparently no closer to happening than it was in 2010, and huge rises in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/14/obesity-almost-doubles-in-20-years-to-affect-13-million-people" title="">number of people who are obese</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/11/cancellations-of-nhs-child-mental-health-sessions-jump-25" title="">children being referred</a> to mental health services.</p><p>The second theme is the prospect of US demands for market access and higher drug prices as part of any post-Brexit trade deal. There were typically <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/04/trump-says-he-turned-down-corbyn-request-to-meet" title="">mixed and confused signals</a> on this issue during the summer from President Trump, and strong denials from Conservative leadership contenders that the NHS would feature in bilateral talks. But set against such assurances are the US administration’s stated goal of raising prices for US medicines abroad, in order to lower them at home, and expert opinion. Andrew Hill, an adviser to the World Health Organization, predicts that the NHS drugs bill could <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/nhs-drugs-bill-could-soar-if-johnson-signs-trump-trade-deal-report" title="">rise</a> from £18bn to £45bn a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-and-the-election-money-talks">Continue reading...</a>

Throwing big numbers around ignores the economic questions that really matter | Carys Roberts
<p>The Tories’ obsession with policy costings as the only measure of economic credibility is austerity logic in action</p><p>This week the election campaign has been squarely focused on public finances, with the Conservatives publishing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/11/labour-spending-tories-young-voters" title="">widely derided £1.2tn assessment</a> of Labour’s spending plans. In spite of the debunking of these figures, the party has doubled down with a separate assessment of Labour’s tax plans – it says Labour’s spending plans outweigh how much it plans to collect in tax, leading to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/will-labour-plans-really-cost-each-taxpayer-2400" title="">£2,400 per taxpayer “gap”</a> that will need to be filled by borrowing or raising taxes.</p><p>Of course, the Conservatives are aware of the quality of the claims they are making. As a tactic, the £1.2tn is straight out of the “£350m a week” playbook: come up with a big figure, and no matter if it’s indefensible, wait for it to stick. The more your opponents complain, the more they end up repeating the big number until it’s indelibly imprinted on voters’ minds.</p><p>While we’re all obsessing over the numbers, we lose sight of the questions that really matter</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/19/worsening-public-finances-hand-next-pm-a-sharp-reality-check">Worsening public finances give next PM a sharp 'reality check'</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/tories-narrow-focus-policy-costings-economic-issues">Continue reading...</a>
