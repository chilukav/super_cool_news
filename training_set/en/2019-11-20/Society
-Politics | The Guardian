UK election: Labour targets the Snapchat youth vote
<p>The digital dashboard: how parties’ spending adds up across social media<br></p><p>The digital election campaign is under way. Different audiences have been thoroughly A/B tested, and the parties have settled on some of their core messaging with the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats all having spent in excess of £100,000 on Facebook and Instagram campaigns to date.</p><p>However, Facebook is not the only place that the parties are spending their money. Another online battleground we’re exploring this week is Google search, where paid ads appear alongside certain keywords. Although there’s often little scrutiny of these ads, they account for a significant amount of online spending – Labour has spent £64,000 since the end of October, equivalent to almost half its Facebook spending.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/uk-election-labour-targets-the-snapchat-youth-vote">Continue reading...</a>

Don’t dismiss the ‘other’ political parties: they might be the future | Alan Finlayson
Groups that existed on the fringe of British politics a generation ago have recently become key players<p>In the 1970s, when I was still at primary school, I was convinced that Britain had four parties: Conservative, Labour, Liberal and Others. Those were the parties listed by the BBC when it showed the running totals of seats on election night.</p><p>When I realised my mistake, the word “others” continued to intrigue me. And I’ve come to think that one way of understanding the last quarter-century of British politics is as the slow reveal of what lay behind that label. In our fragmented political culture, parties that once didn’t warrant a namecheck now help make the running.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/other-political-parties-future-election">Continue reading...</a>


For people on low incomes, free internet access would be life-changing | Rachel Connolly
When you can’t afford broadband at home, everything – from school work to Ucas or benefit applications – is more difficult<p>A lot of the discussion about Labour’s promise to provide free fibreoptic broadband for all has revolved around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/labour-free-broadband-digital-future-public" title="">economics</a>, <a href="https://politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/108015/yougov-snap-poll-reveals-public" title="">speculative polling</a> and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/18/broadband-communism-founding-nhs" title="">“communism”</a>.

Internet access is generally bad in rural communities, but I lived in Belfast: it was just one utility bill too many.

Calling Corbyn a ‘terrorist sympathiser’ is just a way to prevent awkward questions | Daniel Finn
Labour’s leader draws fire because he doesn’t go along with the double standards ruling the UK’s relations with foreign powers<p>Last week Jeremy Corbyn was branded a “terrorist sympathiser” by a heckler in Glasgow, who demanded to know where his “Islamic jihad scarf” could be found.</p><p>The moment, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1203857/election-2019-jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-glasgow-heckler-video-IRA" title="">gleefully covered</a> by the rightwing press, lost some of its lustre when it emerged that the heckler, a Church of Scotland minister called Richard Cameron, allegedly had a back catalogue of Islamophobic and homophobic tweets. But the reverend’s terrorist sympathiser insult did not come out of nowhere. David Cameron, then serving as prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/01/cameron-accuses-corbyn-of-being-terrorist-sympathiser" title="">denounced Corbyn</a> and his colleagues in precisely the same terms when he opposed airstrikes in Syria in December 2015. And Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/news/86272/boris-johnson-calls-corbyn-terror-speech-absolutely-monstrous" title="">accused</a> Jeremy Corbyn of seeking to “legitimate the actions of terrorists” in his <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/05/jeremy-corbyn-speech-terrorism-and-foreign-policy-full-text" title="">speech</a> after the 2017 Manchester bombing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/corbyn-terrorist-sympathiser-double-standards">Continue reading...</a>


Corbyn needs to rouse his fighting spirit to win this election | Aditya Chakrabortty
<p>The ITV leaders’ debate had no victor. Johnson was a one-trick Brexit pony but Corbyn failed to land an attack</p><p>The secret of winning leaders’ debates was taught to David Cameron before the very first one, in the spring of 2010. <a href="http://www.skdknick.com/staff/anita-dunn/] [http://www.skdknick.com/staff/bill-knapp-political_strategist/" title="">They weren’t debates at all</a>, he was told by two leading (and doubtless expensive) media operatives who’d helped get Barack Obama elected. “You don’t want to engage with your opponents’ arguments, you just want to put your own point across,” Cameron recalls in his recent memoir. “Just get your ‘zinger’ – a one-liner destined for the headlines on the news programmes after the show – ready beforehand and deploy it as soon as you can.”</p><p>That is the best explanation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/general-election-leaders-debate-who-won-jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson" title="">Boris Johnson’s performance in last night’s debate</a>.

Labour’s vision has a commonsense jewel at its heart: universal services | Frances Ryan
<p>In a country where poor people are doing DIY dentistry, the idea has a human as well as financial value</p><p>When Labour releases its manifesto on Thursday, all eyes will be on the policies, from high-speed broadband, <a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-announces-plans-scrap-prescription-charges/" title="">scrapping prescription charges</a> and ending tuition fees to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50448108" title="">free dental check-ups</a>. What’s really interesting, though, isn’t the policies themselves but the principle that binds them: universal services.</p><p>Be it healthcare or access to the internet, the message that comes with these measures is one of collective politics – the notion that the state has a duty to provide top-rate services for all, and that a society is better when it pools resources to ensure no one misses out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/labour-universal-services">Continue reading...</a>


‘Englishness’ was never enough to build a nation on | Alex Niven
<p>With the union under unprecedented strain, it’s time for a radical new vision that goes beyond narrow nationalisms</p><p>During his brief tenure as prime minister, Boris Johnson has flaunted his disregard for the tenets of Tory traditionalism. In an eventful few months, he has misled the monarchy and belittled the judiciary. But the bigger surprise has been his indifference to Conservative unionism. While Theresa May’s Brexit strategy faltered partly because she believed in the inviolability of the United Kingdom, Johnson seems relatively relaxed about the prospect of his party surrendering nearly all its seats in Scotland – and, in theory at least, about sacrificing some of Northern Ireland’s statutory Britishness if it will smooth the passage of a Brexit deal.</p><p>All of this suggests that Johnson’s vision for government, if it can be called that, is a specifically English one. There is underlying logic here. With Scottish independence and Irish reunification now looming somewhere in the middle distance, it makes sense for Johnson to view unionism as a hopeless cause, and to think about ways of governing England after the United Kingdom crumbles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/englishness-union-radical-vision-nationalisms">Continue reading...</a>


I’ll take Labour dithering over Conservative cruelty any day | George Monbiot

The Guardian view on the TV election debate: political theatre needs a new script | Editorial
<p>The UK requires an alternative to the mean-spirited and sterile political conversations that have dominated political life since 2016</p><p>Jeremy Corbyn rose to power on the back of the incontestable argument that Britain needed a kinder, more decent politics. Boris Johnson promised to be an inclusive “one nation” Conservative. There was little of either sentiment on display in the first televised election <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50472452" title="">debate</a> between the two men on ITV on Tuesday night. Both traded ever lower blows as they found the body of their respective arguments too well protected. This was in many ways a wasted opportunity. There are real issues at stake during this campaign: about this country’s future relationship with Europe, about how to rebuild the fabric of society after almost a decade of austerity, about how to bring people together across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Opinion is divided and politicians need to bridge the yawning chasms, not widen them.</p><p>TV debates are now part of the political theatre of this country’s elections. Participants consider them not a stage to win over committed opponents but an opportunity to write a new script. On Tuesday night each man looked for ways to make his opponent seem weak and incompetent, as well as out of touch with public opinion. Mr Johnson’s irritable responses drew <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/election-debate-boris-johnson-laugh-heckled-itv-truth-lie-brexit-a9209836.html" title="">laughter</a> from the audience and he repeatedly attempted to cast this election as a way, in his own words, to “get Brexit done”. Mr Corbyn did little to charm his detractors, but he carried a simple message: if you want to get rid of the Tories, vote Labour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-tv-election-debate-political-theatre-needs-a-new-script">Continue reading...</a>
