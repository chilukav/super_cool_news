Dopamine fasting: why Silicon Valley is trying to avoid all forms of stimulation
<p>It’s the latest trend in the world’s tech capital. But is it really possible to cut yourself off from everything in life that excites you – and can it be any good for you?</p><p>They have done <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/21/extreme-biohacking-tech-guru-who-spent-250000-trying-to-live-for-ever-serge-faguet" title="">biohacking</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/21/sleep-has-been-monetised-how-tiresome" title="">clean sleeping</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/07/ketogenic-diet-high-fat-epilepsy-weight-loss" title="">keto diet</a>, but now Silicon Valley types have coined a new health trend – dopamine fasting. It is thought that depriving yourself of the neurotransmitter, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/03/dopamine-the-unsexy-truth" title="">a chemical messenger</a> that motivates us to do things, can help to reboot or rebalance the brain.

The final selfie frontier: app takes pictures from 36,000km up in space

They then take a photo of themselves at the moment the satellite is taking its photo and later the same day the app sends back the satellite image juxtaposed with the selfie to be viewed in its gallery.

We spend so much time staring at our phones. What do we miss when we don't look up? | Mel Campbell
<p>The deeply corny film Last Christmas was maligned for its main character’s ‘look up’ philosophy. But perhaps it’s the philosophy we need right now</p><p>In Paul Feig’s romantic comedy Last Christmas, jaded Londoner Kate (Emilia Clarke) notices a handsome stranger, Tom (Henry Golding), outside the Christmas-themed shop where she works. “Look up,” he tells her.</p><p>She follows Tom’s gaze … and spots a peregrine falcon on a high ledge. However, she immediately cops an eyeful of bird shit – just as she later stumbles into a pile of rubbish while looking up at a delightful old shop sign.

Online politics needs to be cleaned up – but not just by Facebook and Twitter | Lisa-Maria Neudert and Phil Howard
<p>Social media platforms do have a role to play, but real change requires political parties to take responsibility<br><br>• Lisa-Maria Neudert and Phil Howard are on the Oxford Technology and Elections Commission</p><p>Social media platforms wanting to help curb political disinformation<strong> </strong>on their sites are offering new ways to avoid it online. Twitter has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election" title="">discontinued all political ads</a> and Facebook has new tools for content moderation.

Google Pixel 4 XL review: not quite ready for primetime
<p>Face Unlock, radar and on-device voice skills show Google’s magic, but some bits need fixing</p><p>Google’s latest Pixel 4 XL smartphone is its bravest yet, throwing out the conventions of old, integrating cutting-edge technology and attempting to round it all out with a special mix of software direct from the Android-maker.</p><p>By now you probably know the drill. The Pixel 4 XL is a metal and glass sandwich like practically every other phone. Unlike most though the aluminium sides have a black textured coating, which aids grip, while the back feels almost like super-smooth skin or silk rather than glass.

Heard mentality: how technology is helping deaf people communicate
<p>Advances in assistive technology and a supportive workplace culture have made it easier for deaf people to work in the tech industry. Lucy Jolin reports</p><p>When Hamish Drewry began his career in IT back in the late 1980s, being a deaf person in tech required a huge amount of effort and organisation. “There was no email and no SMS,” he remembers. “Everything was done verbally and by telephone. Communicating in meetings was really difficult. I had a sign language interpreter engaged for every meeting, but it was a huge effort to coordinate.</p><p>“Someone would say they couldn’t make a meeting scheduled for 2pm, so could we make it 3pm? Then the interpreter wouldn’t be able to make that time. I dealt with it and took it in my stride. But it was an extra layer of admin and friction around every meeting.

Why are virtual assistants always female? Gender bias in AI must be remedied

Do I really need fibre broadband?
<p>Angela is a light internet user and is wondering if she could make do with an older, slower ADSL service</p><p>I signed up for fibre broadband a couple of years ago but am now wondering whether it is worth the cost.

Which reasonably priced smartphone could replace my old Nokia Lumia?
<p>Jim doesn’t need a high-end mobile, but would like something he can rely on at a decent price</p><p>My Nokia Lumia 820 smartphone is approaching obsolescence after six years’ use. Apart from that, I used a second-hand iPhone for a week before it failed, but I have never used an Android phone. I am clearly not someone who places a premium on having the latest phone, but I would like something I can rely on. I don’t use phones for music on the go – I still use iPods – and I very rarely watch videos on them: I use my laptop for that. I have a sim-only contract and the idea of spending £700 or so on a phone doesn’t really apply to my wants, needs or financial reality<em>.</em> <strong>Jim</strong></p><p>Every Windows smartphone user should be thinking about this topic, because Microsoft will <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4485197/windows-10-mobile-end-of-support-faq">stop supporting the platform</a> roughly a month from today, on 10 December 2019.

Which is the best streaming service for supporting artists?
<p>Robert still listens to MP3s but wants wants to know which music service pays artists best</p><p>I’m a big music fan and enjoy listening to music through my PC and phone, but I feel stuck in the last century as I still listen to my MP3 collection. I refuse to get Spotify, as it’s such a bad deal for the artists. Are there any alternatives that treat the artist well? <strong>Robert</strong></p><p>Your problem is that you don’t really have a problem. I’m in almost exactly the same position, only slightly worse, because I still use an MP3 player to listen to albums in MP3 format.

Which is best: iPad Air or iPad Pro 11?
<p>Len wants to replace a Samsung Tab S2. Should he buy the 11in iPad Pro or an iPad Air with extra storage?</p><p>I use a 9.7in Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet for general browsing, emails, reading digital magazines and some very basic photo editing. It only has 32GB of storage so some apps are installed on its 128GB SD card. However, the battery is no longer what it was, and Samsung has not updated its version of Android, so it is still running Android 7.</p><p>I am thinking of getting a new iPad because Apple seems to support machines for longer, the apps seem better suited to my needs and, anecdotally, they appear to be more secure. On my budget, I can’t decide between an iPad Air with 256GB and an iPad Pro 11 with 64GB. Both will fit in my camera bag. Is it better to opt for a tablet with more built-in storage or one with a better processor? <strong>Len</strong></p><p>The challenge for anyone designing a computing device – whether it’s a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone – is to create a machine that is properly balanced to meet its user’s needs at the price being charged. This is not an exact science. It depends on the cost of major components such as the processor and memory, screen, graphics, storage modules, operating system and so on. But you trust them not to saddle low-end devices with the cost of high-end processors, or to compromise high-end devices by providing too little memory and/or storage space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/oct/24/which-is-best-ipad-air-or-ipad-pro-11">Continue reading...</a>

I want a laptop where I can easily replace components such as memory and hard drives. How does one go about finding out which modern laptops are modifiable by users? <strong>Colin</strong></p><p>The one-sentence answer is that consumer laptops often can’t be modified by users, while business laptops can.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order review – the force is strong in this one
<p><strong>PC, PS4 (version tested), Xbox One; Electronic Arts<br></strong>With its satisfyingly challenging lightsaber combat and on-brand recreation of the Star Wars galaxy, this is the game fans have been waiting for</p><p>Star Wars video game fans have waited impatiently – for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/oct/23/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-is-this-the-star-wars-game-fans-have-been-looking-for">almost a decade</a> – for a romp through their favourite galaxy in the best traditions of the action-adventure game. Out of mercy (for I, too, am a fanatic), I’ll cut to the chase: Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order does indeed deliver on that. Hitting all the right notes – and not just with the fluttering woodwind and heavy brass of the John Williams-styled orchestra – Fallen Order is right on brand.</p><p>It has the ancient ruins of mystical past civilisations seamlessly blended with the crashed hulks of light-speeding starships; the militaristic, sterile, black and red halls of the Empire, with rapidly sliding doors that open on to lush landscapes. Alien life lurks everywhere, some cutesy, some deadly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review">Continue reading...</a>


Doom creator John Romero on what's wrong with modern shooter games
<p>The id Software founder talks about secret rooms, the value of guns and what the controversial genre has lost since the 1990s</p><p>“Give us more guns!” is a common battle-cry among players of first-person shooters, the videogame industry’s bloodiest genre. Doom co-creator John Romero has a rather different opinion.</p><p>“I would rather have fewer things with more meaning, than a million things you don’t identify with,” he says, sitting in a Berlin bar mocked up to resemble a 1920s Chicago speakeasy. “I would rather spend more time with a gun and make sure the gun’s design is really deep – that there’s a lot of cool stuff you learn about it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/12/doom-creator-john-romero-shooter-games-id-software">Continue reading...</a>


'I care about Blizzard but the Hong Kong situation is dire': the gaming convention rocked by protest
<p>This year’s BlizzCon, a 35,000-strong event in California for fans of World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Hearthstone, was embroiled in a battle over free speech and China</p><p>Eric did not imagine this would be how he would spend his first <a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-gb/">BlizzCon</a>. The 26-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> (WoW) player from Glendale, California, was at the annual fan event in Anaheim held by Blizzard, the games company behind global hits such as Warcraft, Overwatch and more. Each year, more than 35,000 people pack into the city’s vast convention centre to play games, attend talks and share in their fandom.</p><p>But at this year’s event, held last weekend, there was a different feel. Instead of WoW cosplay, Eric was sporting a mask as worn by Hong Kong protesters to shield their faces from tear gas and facial recognition. And rather than joining in with the hype during panels about the forthcoming World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion, he was outside the convention centre handing out “Liberate Hong Kong” flyers, adorned with the protestors’ adopted symbol, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/overwatch-how-blizzard-redefined-the-first-person-shooter">Overwatch</a> character Mei.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/08/blizzard-blizzcon-protest-hong-kong-world-of-warcraft">Continue reading...</a>
