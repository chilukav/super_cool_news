Liberal Democrat manifesto: key policies explained
<p>From revoking article 50 to legalising cannabis, here are the key pledges made by the party</p><p><strong>Brexit <br></strong>A majority Lib Dem government would revoke article 50 and ensure Britain stays in the EU. In other circumstances, they would champion a second referendum with the option of staying in Europe, which they would actively campaign for. They describe Brexit as a “national humiliation” that ultimately costs the NHS, public services, scientific collaboration, peace in Northern Ireland and the ability to tackle climate change. But their “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/lib-dems-manifesto-pledges-5bn-duty-rise-for-frequent-flyers">remain bonus</a>” of £50bn is the basis for a lot of the manifesto’s spending commitments, and this pot of money comes from forecasts of higher growth for the UK economy in a remain scenario. Their votes at 16 policy would also come into play if there was another Brexit vote.</p><p><strong>Education <br></strong>Jo Swinson has made much of her party’s offer for children and families and education makes up the lengthiest portion of the manifesto. Headline-grabbing policies are plugging the gap in childcare for working parents by offering free hours between nine months and two years old. They would triple the early years pupil premium to help the most disadvantaged children, scrap Sats exams, hire 20,000 more teachers and pay new recruits a starting salary of £30,000. Michael Gove’s legacy education policy, the Ebacc, would also be scrapped. A form of the popular education maintenance allowance would make a return in the form of a new “young people’s premium”, a portion of which would go to 16-18-year-olds directly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/liberal-democrat-manifesto-key-policies-explained">Continue reading...</a>

Finally, the public wants action on the climate crisis. Now politics must catch up | Stephen Buranyi
A cosy consensus among politicians allowed lofty targets to be set, and then ignored. But now voters want actual solutions<br /><p>The most shocking political development of 2019 may be the end of the nearly three-decade old consensus that the public doesn’t care about the climate crisis. People were hopelessly and permanently apathetic, the argument went, or unable to see beyond the present. They were said to suffer what Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger memorably called “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/17/apocalypse-public-climate-change" title="">apocalypse fatigue</a>”, a numbness brought on by years of scientific warnings about a dismal future. And this in turn meant they were uninterested in, if not outright hostile to, any kind of meaningful climate action.</p><p>All of this appeared to be backed up by data. Years of polling and other measures of public engagement showed that even as awareness of the crisis grew, there was no interest in changing anything.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/21/climate-crisis-politics-voters-targets-action">Continue reading...</a>


This is my first vote. I’m elated it’s in such an important election | Nesrine Malik
We know what to expect from the Tories, so next month’s poll is our opportunity to transform the country’s destiny<p>This is the first election in which I am allowed to vote. It has been an exasperating experience having to sit by and watch, election after election, restricted by a Home Office that was either sitting on my application or taking wrong decisions, delaying my naturalisation as a British citizen far beyond the moment when I felt like one. But a British passport arrived earlier this year, and Brexit has provided a bonus general election to slake an appetite built over years locked out of the democratic process. Whatever the opposite of jaded is, that’s what I am.</p><p>My sense of exclusion has intensified over the past three years as a Brexit referendum and a general election have plunged the country into a state of instability that still seems to have no resolution. This election feels crucial to the point of angst. The stakes could not be higher. Not only does what happens with Brexit hang in the balance, but also the very character of the country and its ideological direction. After a decade in which austerity is estimated to have cost <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2017/nov/austerity-linked-120000-extra-deaths-england" title="">more than 120,000 lives</a>, it is not an exaggeration to say that the coming election is a matter of life and death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/21/first-vote-important-election">Continue reading...</a>

Labour targets renters with pledge of 100,000 council houses a year
<p>Plan to borrow £75bn to fund affordable homes may appeal to those in private rental sector</p><p>Danielle Morey, 28, has a problem in common with millions of other voters in Britain today: she can’t afford to buy a home and doesn’t qualify for oversubscribed social housing for which over a million people are waiting. So her only option is to rent privately. In a parallel reality, that is where this story would end. Morey would find a place and settle down with her fiance, young son and 11-month old daughter. Instead, her family has been forced to move nine times in the past decade because of problems such as mould or being evicted through no fault of their own. Her four-year old boy, who is starting school, has already lived in four different homes.</p><p>“I am really interested in what the parties say on social housing,” she said. “We have been looking at who to vote for, but it seems hardly anyone is interested in getting younger families into affordable housing, and I mean actually affordable [cheaper than 80% of market rent, which is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2014/feb/03/affordable-housing-meaning-rent-social-housing">common definition of affordable</a>].”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/labour-targets-renters-with-pledge-of-100000-council-houses-a-year">Continue reading...</a>

Labour must turbocharge its offer to young people. The fate of the country depends on it | Owen Jones
The party’s manifesto has to convince voters under 40 it is worth voting for Corbyn, or Johnson will triumph<p>Labour’s fate – and with it that of the country – now rests with the young: not just the fresh-faced undergraduates of Lancaster and Cardiff but the sleep-deprived 35-year-old mums and dads of Hastings and Pembrokeshire. Just as at this stage in the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39869459" title="">2017 election</a> – and no, the past is no automatic predictor – Labour’s polling ranges from <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/uk-election-polls-tracker-tories-out-in-front-with-13point-lead-on-labour-according-to-average-of-a4289536.html" title="">not good to very bad</a>.

But the latest research does indeed suggest <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/youthquake-did-back-corbyn-and-labour-in-2017-general-election-study-11573148" title="">that an increase in younger turnout played a key role</a>.

The Guardian view on the Lib Dem manifesto: missing the moderate opportunity | Editorial
<p>Jo Swinson’s commitment to revoke article 50 is a drastic measure that sits awkwardly with her party’s claim to the centre ground</p><p>Britain’s electoral system is cruel to small parties. What prominence they achieve in mid-term local government ballots and byelections is lost in a general election, when cultural habit and constituency arithmetic see the traditional Labour-Conservative duopoly reassert itself in England. In a general election the identity of the next prime minister is also uppermost in voters’ minds. That person is unlikely to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jo-swinson" title="">Jo Swinson</a>. The Liberal Democrat leader insists she is capable of the job and her credentials are no worse than those of any other candidate. But Ms Swinson will not command a majority in the next parliament and the public knows it.</p><p>Yet the Lib Dems’ most prominent policy – cancelling Brexit by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/lib-dems-pledge-to-revoke-brexit-without-referendum" title="">revoking article 50</a> – is predicated on that outcome. Their credibility suffers as a result. The party’s manifesto, published on Wednesday, recognises that “in other circumstances” EU membership would be defended in a second referendum. How those circumstances might be engineered is not clear. Nor, in fairness, are potential deals and coalitions a matter for the manifesto, which has to presume Lib Dem government even if no one else does.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-lib-dem-manifesto-missing-the-moderate-opportunity">Continue reading...</a>
