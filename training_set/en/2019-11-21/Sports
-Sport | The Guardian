Talking Horses: Lib Dems pledge new regulatory body for welfare
<p>BHA says policy in party’s manifesto ‘would not help’ advance horse welfare in racing</p><p>Horse racing got a walk-on part in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-lib-dem-manifesto-missing-the-moderate-opportunity">published on Wednesday</a>, in the form of a pledge to “establish an independent regulatory body for horse welfare to prevent the abuse and avoidable deaths of racehorses”.

Pochettino pays price for Spurs’ failure of renewal but Mourinho is a big gamble | Jonathan Wilson
<p>Tottenham’s current woes are rooted in the lack of signings two summers ago but is José Mourinho really the right fit?</p><p>Fifty years ago this season Liverpool went to Watford, then struggling near the bottom of the Second Division, in the sixth round of the FA Cup. On a dreadful pitch, its central third rutted and bare, they lost 1-0 to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSxN6-csiNA" title="">diving header from Barry Endean</a>. Bill Shankly called Watford “the worst team that ever beat us”. He was aware the upset could be as epochal as the defeat to Worcester City that had led to him replacing Phil Taylor as manager in 1959 and was provoked into action. “I knew I had to do my job and change my team,” he said. “It had to be done and if I didn’t do it I was shirking my obligations.”</p><p>Although Liverpool had finished second the previous season, they were enduring a major stutter, having won only five of their previous 18 in the league. He raged in the Vicarage Road dressing room, telling a number of players they were finished. Over the following weeks Tommy Lawrence, Ian St John, Ron Yeats and Geoff Strong were all discarded. Peter Thompson, struggling with cartilage problems, departed a few months later. The players changed, but the method did not. “The policy of the new team was the same as that of the old,” Shankly explained. “We played to our strengths. We pressurised everybody and made them run.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/20/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-jose-mourinho-gamble-jonathan-wilson">Continue reading...</a>

Gareth Bale and that 'Wales, golf, Madrid' flag: Real are not amused
<p>The banner is a laugh. And yet, importantly, the Welshman surely knows that most in Madrid won’t find it funny</p><p>It was Pedja Mijatovic who started it. One night on the radio, the former Real Madrid player and sporting director said he hadn’t spoken to Gareth Bale but the impression he got was that his priorities were Wales, golf, and Madrid – and in that order. That sounded pretty good to Wales fans, already on his side. Songs followed swiftly and so did the flags. One of them found its way on to the pitch and into the players’ hands as they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/wales-hungary-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report">celebrated reaching Euro 2020</a>. Dancing about and grinning right behind it is Bale, enjoying the silliness of it all, the caption covering half his body: “Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.”</p><p>Bale had said he was aware of the chant, the slogan, and here it was in black and white (and green and red). “I’ve heard it, especially when I was on the bench, and the boys were laughing,” he explained. “It’s a good bit of fun.” Which it may be to him, although there is something pointed in it too, but a lot of people don’t see the funny side. Some of them are at the Santiago Bernabéu: Madrid are not amused. This has not pleased anyone there, but nor has it entirely surprised them: there is a sense that this does not break anything, exactly; it merely underlines that something was already broken. It was a joke, they know, but not in great taste and with a message attached to it – if only because he didn’t distance himself from it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/20/gareth-bale-and-that-wales-golf-madrid-flag-real-are-not-amused">Continue reading...</a>

Why punching your opponent in hockey is fine but spitting on him is not
<p>Hockey confrontations may appear as nothing more than mindless violence but there are unwritten rules even amidst the chaos</p><p>When done properly, a hockey fight between two (or more) consenting adults is a beautiful tradition with its own rules. There’s a disagreement between opposing players due to a rough hit or perceived dirty play – either in the immediate moments before a fight or in a prior meeting. Then there’s a square-up, a silent agreement between the two enemies that a brawl is about to happen. After that there’s a roar from the crowd as they realize what’s taking place, and finally, a slippery festival of lefts and rights as both players attempt a delicate balancing act in which they damage their opponent with punches without embarrassing themselves by falling on their asses. (There’s a reason they don’t sanction proper boxing matches on skates!)</p><p>The hockey fight looks to be a dying art, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/fighting-in-nhl-hit-record-lows-during-2018-2019-season-continuing-downward-trend/">sinking below a fight every five games</a> in the NHL – and rightfully so, given the fact that the NHL’s top enforcers of yesteryear have a <a href="https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/2015/09/22/list-of-nhl-enforcers-who-have-passes-away-gets-longer.html">habit of dying too young</a>.

Mourinho is also understood to be an admirer of Bournemouth defender <strong>Nathan Aké</strong> but is “willing to lose” want-away trio <strong>Toby Alderweireld</strong>, <strong>Jan Vertonghen</strong> and <strong>Christian Eriksen</strong>, according to the Express.

Rugby World Cup 2019: Guardian writers' teams of the tournament
<p>The hosts’ Michael Leitch deserves a special mention while England’s Tom Curry and Handre Pollard cannot be omitted</p><p>While South Africa’s final surge tipped the scales in a couple of positions, Pieter-Steph du Toit is an unlucky absentee. But how could you possibly omit the incredible Japan captain, Michael Leitch, or the youthful Tom Curry from the back row? Only one All Black tells its own story but the semi-final against England defined New Zealand’s World Cup. There is one place too, for an Argentinian – the hooker Julián Montoya. Handre Pollard kicked almost everything when it mattered, Kyle Sinckler and Maro Itoje are included on merit and Faf de Klerk is selected both for his nuisance value and world-class ability to spin the ball on one finger. John Denver’s ageless Take Me Home, Country Roads is the official team soundtrack.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/rugby-world-cup-2019-guardian-writers-teams-of-the-tournament">Continue reading...</a>

Japan 2019 might be the moment rugby union glimpsed a more fulfilling future | Robert Kitson
<p>Can-do spirit and a receptive host country look to have opened new markets for what has been a virtually landlocked sport</p><p>On stage at the World Rugby awards ceremony on Sunday evening the extraordinary Siya Kolisi was asked what kind of public reaction he and his team were expecting on their return to South Africa. “I’m not sure,” replied the Springbok captain, a note of uncertainty in his voice. He sounded like a bemused lottery winner still attempting to compute how much his life had just changed.</p><p>The heartfelt roar from the entire South Africa squad when Rassie Erasmus was announced as the world coach of the year was equally endearing. As Erasmus admitted, the team did not arrive in Japan necessarily expecting a successful outcome; in his view three key things – hard work, luck and destiny – propelled them to victory. His squad, he said, did not just want to boost their country’s spirits, they felt an absolute responsibility to do so. To paint their triumph merely as a nice rugby story ignores the inspirational bigger picture surrounding it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/04/japan-2019-rugby-union-future-world-cup-can-do-spirit-japan">Continue reading...</a>


Ten key themes as World Cup says sayonara to Japan | Paul Rees
<p>Momentum proved a myth, cracking down on high tackles was a success and emerging nations showed their worth</p><p>It looked like advantage to the holders after they effectively decided the pool pecking order on the opening weekend, but it prompted South Africa’s head coach, Rassie Erasmus, to make a significant change. The Springboks conceded only four tries in the tournament, two against the All Blacks. Erasmus used a conventional split of five forwards and three backs on the bench on that evening, but he changed it to six-two for the pool match against Italy and the three knockout games, giving him an alternative tight five to maintain physical power and mental sharpness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/04/key-themes-world-cup-japan-2019">Continue reading...</a>


World Cup offered timely reminder of rugby’s values, on and off the pitch
Japan’s hosting showed what the game might become while South Africa’s victory offered succour to its people<p>So in the end Jack did not kill the 15 giants. But still the Rugby World Cup had a different kind of fairytale finish. Siya Kolisi, South Africa’s first black captain, a kid from a township outside Port Elizabeth, led his team to a famous victory. And a team that once epitomised the apartheid regime was reborn, at last, as one offering the promise of togetherness. It was not long ago that the Springboks were jeered by black South Africans. Now they are being cheered by them. They have made good on Nelson Mandela’s words from 1995. “Sport has the power to unite people in a way that little else does,” Mandela said, “Sport can create hope where once there was despair.”</p><p>We should not garnish it any more than that. If anything, this may be the moment to offer a timely reminder that we should not overreach or strain to explain the significance of all this. South Africa’s coach, Rassie Erasmus, was absolutely clear about the limits of what his team had achieved. The World Cup final had bought his country 80 minutes of togetherness, Erasmus said, and a couple of happy hours after the match when people back home had put aside their differences. Nothing more than that. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/02/south-africa-springboks-england-rugby-world-cup-victory-motivation" title="">social problems he and Kolisi spoke so openly about this week</a> will not be fixed by this victory.

Still, there are certainly more obvious ways of honouring your favourite cricketer, whether it be a tattoo, some heartfelt fan-mail or presenting them with a lovely bunch of Jack Hobbses, or perhaps a bouquet of Larwoods.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/19/sweet-peas-ships-and-now-spiders-the-wider-world-inspired-by-cricket-the-spin">Continue reading...</a>

It would be just over six months before he would return to action, in a home match with arch-rivals Liverpool. After serving one of the longest bans in football history, Cantona’s impact was instantaneous. He crafted the opening goal after just 67 seconds of the match, teeing up teammate Nicky Butt, before a Robbie Fowler double gave the visitors a 2-1 lead. Poetically, the fate of the match came to rest on Cantona’s shoulders when Ryan Giggs won a 71st-minute penalty. Cantona, hands on hips, oozed confidence before casually stroking the spot-kick into one corner as the goalkeeper dived to the other. The subsequent celebration was distinctly odd: he pole-danced in front of the East Stand. Why such a celebration, you might ask? Because ... er, he’s Eric Cantona.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/19/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-cantonas-comeback">Continue reading...</a>

Kane Williamson: New Zealand’s world-class captain who ‘wasn’t like other kids’ | Simon Burnton
The 29-year-old excelled at basketball, volleyball, football and rugby as a child but is now a batsman without obvious flaws<br />• We are expanding our coverage of New Zealand. <br /><a href="https://support.theguardian.com/au/contribute?acquisitionData=%7B%22componentType%22%3A%22ACQUISITIONS_EDITORIAL_LINK%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%2C%22campaignCode%22%3A%22AUS_EDITORIAL%22%2C%22componentId%22%3A%22All-blacks_pool_games%22%7D&amp;INTCMP=AUS_EDITORIAL" title="">Please help us by supporting our independent journalism</a><p>As England prepare for the start of their Test series in New Zealand, history suggests they should be wary of unintended consequences and unnecessary generosity. For the presence in New Zealand’s team of a batsman and captain of genuine world class is, at least in small part, down to their own past failure in this respect.</p><p>In the winter of 2001-02, while England’s cricket team toured New Zealand, Graham Thorpe gave an old bat to Mark Patterson, his former Surrey teammate. Patterson was playing for Mount Maunganui at the time and, though he failed to find a use for Thorpe’s old bat, he passed it on to another Mount player, Jim Irwin. The bat laid unused in a corner of the Irwin household for a couple of years before he in turn offered it to Bill Aldridge, a keen player and coach whose son Graeme was to enjoy a very brief international career, which amounted to three limited-overs matches in the space of eight days in October 2011. Aldridge also decided not to keep it, giving it instead to a promising local 12-year-old, who thought it too big and heavy and, besides, he had just bought himself a new one of a more appropriate size, so he too ignored it. The child’s name was Kane Williamson.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/19/kane-williamson-new-zealand-england-first-test">Continue reading...</a>


When Saturday Comes in peril should bother everyone who cares about football | Barney Ronay
<p>The only independent national football magazine to make it through the game’s boom times is now in need of a lifeboat</p><p>Who are the good guys anyway? It can be hard to tell. Compromise, commercial interests, good intentions cut with contradictions. Professional sport exists within this nexus. And nobody gets out of it clean. Or almost nobody.</p><p>Often villainy is the whole point. Take, for example, Edmundo, bad-boy Brazilian goal ace of the 1990s. In June 1996 the São Paulo Federation called Edmundo to a disciplinary tribunal after another violent sending-off. Fearing a ban, his club, Corinthians, took along a video of the incident, promising to prove Edmundo had only unintentionally punched the Santos defender Sandro in the mouth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/16/when-saturday-comes-everyone-who-cares-about-football">Continue reading...</a>


The NFL cares more about optics than actions in its fight against dirty play

Garrett will miss at least the remainder of the regular season and the postseason if Cleveland manage to qualify. The league also suspended Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey three games and Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi one game for their roles in the brawl and fined the teams $250,000 apiece.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/15/myles-garrett-suspension-browns-steelers-fight">NFL hits Browns' Myles Garrett with indefinite ban for helmet attack</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/15/damarious-randall-myles-garrett-browns-steelers">Continue reading...</a>


Premier League 2019-20: team of the season so far
<p>Liverpool’s full-backs, the beating hearts of Chelsea and Sheffield United and an evergreen striker make our leading XI</p><p>The biggest compliment that can be paid to the Leicester goalkeeper is that he has gone unnoticed this season. The 33-year-old has kept goal with quiet authority as Leicester’s defence has become the stingiest in the league, conceding only eight times. Ederson might have been a more obvious choice but the Brazilian has not been as assured for Manchester City this season. Schmeichel has been error-free and solid with his distribution. An honourable mention should go to Ben Foster who has made some wonderful stops while being overworked at Watford.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/15/premier-league-2019-20-team-of-the-season-so-far">Continue reading...</a>
