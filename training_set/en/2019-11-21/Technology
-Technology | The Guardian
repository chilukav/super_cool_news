Home alarm systems: how can I improve my security?
<p>Peter has to move from his very secure high-rise flat and wants to avoid being burgled</p><p>I currently live in a high-rise flat, which is very secure, with CCTV, <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/K/key_fob.html">fob-controlled access</a> and so on. Unfortunately, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenfell_Tower_fire">Grenfell</a>, our block is being emptied for refurbishment. I don’t know what type of property I will be offered, but I will have to provide my own home security system. Cost is not a major issue, because I will get a disturbance grant for the enforced move. But, as a pensioner, I wouldn’t like to be saddled with a high monthly premium for monitoring. Any suggestions would be very welcome<em>.</em> <strong>Peter</strong></p><p>Technology companies are selling a lot of new gadgets to increase home security, including smart locks, motion detectors, window sensors and digital cameras.

How our home delivery habit reshaped the world
<p>The great trick of online retail has been to get us to shop more and think less about how our purchases reach our homes. By Samanth Subramanian</p><p>A decade ago, the British department-store chain John Lewis built itself a long warehouse, painted in gradations of sky blue. The shed, as it is called in the industry, cost £100m and covered 650,000 sq ft. Windsor Castle could easily fit inside it. John Lewis named the shed Magna Park 1, after the site where it stands: a “logistics campus” of warehouses, roads, shipping containers and truck bays east of Milton Keynes. Magna Park 1 was intended to supply the company’s stores around southern England, but almost as soon as it was finished, John Lewis realised that it wasn’t enough. The pace of e-commerce was flying, and Magna Park 1 opened in the midst of a spell in which, between 2006 and 2016, the share of John Lewis deliveries going direct to customers <a href="https://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/content/cws/media/press/y2016/press-release-6-september-2016-john-lewis-opens-150m-customer-centric-distribution-facility.html" title="">rose 12-fold</a>.</p><p>So John Lewis built Magna Park 2, measuring 675,000 sq ft. After that, the company realised it needed a new shed for Waitrose, its supermarket chain, where home deliveries were skyrocketing, too. “It became a bit of a standing joke,” said Philip Stanway, a regional director at Chetwoods, the architecture firm that designed and built all these facilities. “They used to come to meetings with their forecasts, and they’d say: ‘Screw this. <em>This</em> is the new forecast,’” Stanway said, making a scribbling motion in the manner of a John Lewis executive hastily updating the numbers. “We couldn’t build the buildings quick enough for them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/21/how-our-home-delivery-habit-reshaped-the-world">Continue reading...</a>

For people on low incomes, free internet access would be life-changing | Rachel Connolly
<p>When you can’t afford broadband at home, everything – from school work to Ucas or benefit applications – is more difficult</p><p>A lot of the discussion about Labour’s promise to provide free fibreoptic broadband for all has revolved around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/labour-free-broadband-digital-future-public" title="">economics</a>, <a href="https://politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/108015/yougov-snap-poll-reveals-public" title="">speculative polling</a> and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/18/broadband-communism-founding-nhs" title="">“communism”</a>. But it has not addressed what life without easy internet access is actually like for people across the country.</p><p>I’m 26 now, and we didn’t have the internet at home when I was a teenager. Internet access is generally bad in rural communities, but I lived in Belfast: it was just one utility bill too many. In fact, it’s still fairly common for people not to have it because of the cost – according to 2017 <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/105507/internet-use-attitudes-bulletin-2017.pdf" title="">figures from Ofcom</a>, only 47% of those on low incomes have broadband internet at home.

Firefox’s fight for the future of the web
With Google’s Chrome dominating the market, not-for-profit rival Mozilla is staking a comeback on its dedication to privacy<p>Why do you choose the browser you use? Maybe you think it loads pages more quickly. Maybe it’s made by the same firm as your device and you think it’s more compatible in some way. You prefer the graphics, perhaps, or it just happened to be pre-installed on your machine. Maybe you’re not even aware that there’s a choice. </p><p>In reality, two-thirds of us have been funnelled into using Google’s Chrome, but browser choice also hides a contest about the openness of the web and how data is collected about users.

Technology will never replace human judgment. Look at football... | Kenan Malik
Technical advances are a boon, but VAR proves they rely on the people using them<p>Even if you can’t tell your offside from your elbow (in the face), you’ve probably heard of VAR. The <a href="http://theifab.com/projects/vars/principles-practicalities-protocol" title="">video assistant referee</a> has been introduced into top-level football to cut out errors by referees. At every Premier League game, a VAR referee watches TV feeds of the game to check potentially contentious decisions.</p><p>Moaning at referees has long been the staple of football fans. “That was never a penalty!” “Ref, do you need glasses?

Do I really need fibre broadband?
<p>Angela is a light internet user and is wondering if she could make do with an older, slower ADSL service</p><p>I signed up for fibre broadband a couple of years ago but am now wondering whether it is worth the cost.

Which reasonably priced smartphone could replace my old Nokia Lumia?
<p>Jim doesn’t need a high-end mobile, but would like something he can rely on at a decent price</p><p>My Nokia Lumia 820 smartphone is approaching obsolescence after six years’ use. Apart from that, I used a second-hand iPhone for a week before it failed, but I have never used an Android phone. I am clearly not someone who places a premium on having the latest phone, but I would like something I can rely on. I don’t use phones for music on the go – I still use iPods – and I very rarely watch videos on them: I use my laptop for that.

Which is the best streaming service for supporting artists?

Which is best: iPad Air or iPad Pro 11?

Should he buy the 11in iPad Pro or an iPad Air with extra storage?</p><p>I use a 9.7in Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet for general browsing, emails, reading digital magazines and some very basic photo editing. It only has 32GB of storage so some apps are installed on its 128GB SD card. However, the battery is no longer what it was, and Samsung has not updated its version of Android, so it is still running Android 7.</p><p>I am thinking of getting a new iPad because Apple seems to support machines for longer, the apps seem better suited to my needs and, anecdotally, they appear to be more secure. On my budget, I can’t decide between an iPad Air with 256GB and an iPad Pro 11 with 64GB. Both will fit in my camera bag. Is it better to opt for a tablet with more built-in storage or one with a better processor? <strong>Len</strong></p><p>The challenge for anyone designing a computing device – whether it’s a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone – is to create a machine that is properly balanced to meet its user’s needs at the price being charged. This is not an exact science. It depends on the cost of major components such as the processor and memory, screen, graphics, storage modules, operating system and so on. But you trust them not to saddle low-end devices with the cost of high-end processors, or to compromise high-end devices by providing too little memory and/or storage space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/oct/24/which-is-best-ipad-air-or-ipad-pro-11">Continue reading...</a>

Hitting all the right notes – and not just with the fluttering woodwind and heavy brass of the John Williams-styled orchestra – Fallen Order is right on brand.</p><p>It has the ancient ruins of mystical past civilisations seamlessly blended with the crashed hulks of light-speeding starships; the militaristic, sterile, black and red halls of the Empire, with rapidly sliding doors that open on to lush landscapes.

Doom creator John Romero on what's wrong with modern shooter games
<p>The id Software founder talks about secret rooms, the value of guns and what the controversial genre has lost since the 1990s</p><p>“Give us more guns!” is a common battle-cry among players of first-person shooters, the videogame industry’s bloodiest genre. Doom co-creator John Romero has a rather different opinion.</p><p>“I would rather have fewer things with more meaning, than a million things you don’t identify with,” he says, sitting in a Berlin bar mocked up to resemble a 1920s Chicago speakeasy. “I would rather spend more time with a gun and make sure the gun’s design is really deep – that there’s a lot of cool stuff you learn about it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/12/doom-creator-john-romero-shooter-games-id-software">Continue reading...</a>

The 26-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> (WoW) player from Glendale, California, was at the annual fan event in Anaheim held by Blizzard, the games company behind global hits such as Warcraft, Overwatch and more. Each year, more than 35,000 people pack into the city’s vast convention centre to play games, attend talks and share in their fandom.</p><p>But at this year’s event, held last weekend, there was a different feel. Instead of WoW cosplay, Eric was sporting a mask as worn by Hong Kong protesters to shield their faces from tear gas and facial recognition. And rather than joining in with the hype during panels about the forthcoming World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion, he was outside the convention centre handing out “Liberate Hong Kong” flyers, adorned with the protestors’ adopted symbol, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/overwatch-how-blizzard-redefined-the-first-person-shooter">Overwatch</a> character Mei.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/08/blizzard-blizzcon-protest-hong-kong-world-of-warcraft">Continue reading...</a>
