Russia is overturning drug convictions after European Court rulings, but its justice system is reluctant to back away from controlled purchases
In 2016, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) agreed to hear complaints brought by nine Russian citizens convicted of drug-related offenses. Irina Khrunova, a lawyer with the “Agora” international human rights group who specializes in drug crimes, is defending four of the Russians who turned to the ECHR. She told Meduza that the main evidence in the cases against all nine of these individuals were so-called “controlled purchases” of narcotics, were police officers recruit known drug dealers and other intermediaries to buy illegal drugs from suspected dealers, in order to confirm their suspicions. The method is one of the most common ways police catch drug dealers.


How a single staffing shakeup changed what Putin's Human Rights Council has to say about the death penalty
On November 19, Supreme Court of Tatarstan Chief Justice Ilgiz Gilazov expressed support for reinstating capital punishment in Russia, asking, “How are we supposed to treat crimes like the ones committed by [Soviet serial killer Andrey] Chikatilo? When there are 50 – 60 bodies… When children are killed? When they’re tormented? Is it really proportional to issue life in prison?” When asked to comment on the prospect of cancelling Russia’s moratorium on the death penalty, newly instated Presidential Human Rights Council Chair Valery Fadeyev said the body had no particular stance on the issue. His predecessor, Mikhail Fedotov, had spoken out against reinstating the death penalty.


Journalists say Russian mercenaries in Syria tortured, beheaded, and burned a deserter from Assad's army. For fun.
The Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta has published new evidence in the torture and beheading of a man in Syria, whose gruesome death was first revealed in a two-minute video released on June 30, 2017. At the time, observers speculated that the Russian-speakers pounding the man with a sledgehammer and chopping at his body with knives and shovels were possibly mercenaries from the “Wagner” private military company. Earlier this month, Novaya Gazeta acquired an additional two videos from the murder scene, and the newspaper says the new footage bolsters suspicions that Russian mercenaries were behind the killing.

Russia's Justice Ministry says journalists distorted its argument that domestic violence claims in Russia are exaggerated. Fine, here's the full quote.
In June of 2019, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) notified the Russian government of four complaints submitted by women who argue that the Russian authorities did not react properly to the domestic violence they faced. Natalia Tunikova was convicted of attacking a partner who was beating her. Yelena Gershman’s husband beat her as well, but investigators refused to open a case against him. Irina Petrakova’s husband was penalized for his abuse, but that penalty was cancelled. Margarita Gracheva’s husband cut off her fingers before being sentenced to 14 years in prison. The four women’s complaints to the ECHR have been unified into a single case. In its communication on the case to the Russian government, the court posed three overarching questions:


After police broke a bystander's leg before a protest, the Russian legal system did nothing. We asked the Kremlin why.
Meduza: In August, you commented on the case of the Moscow-based designer Konstantin Konovalov, whose leg was broken by police officers shortly before the July 27 protest. At the time, you said that every case should be handled individually. Yesterday, the Moscow City Court put an end to this particular case: It ruled that the Investigative Committee acted correctly when it refused to investigate Konovalov’s broken bone. What is the Kremlin’s opinion on where Konovalov can turn now if neither Russia’s law enforcement apparatus nor its courts want to deal with the police officers who broke his leg at the protest?

Russian environmental activists and inflatable orca kayak past Kremlin in protest action
The Russian branch of the environmental activism group Greenpeace took to the water on Monday to protest the capture and imprisonment of dolphins and whales. In the protest action, activists kayaked on either side of an inflatable killer whale past the walls of Moscow’s Kremlin. Between the orca’s fins was a sign that read “Thank you for letting us go — now don’t hunt us anymore,” a reference to the “whale prison” at Russia’s far southeastern corner where about a hundred orcas and beluga whales were held against their will. They were released into the Sea of Japan in early November. Novaya Gazeta reported that police officers arrested two activists and one of the newspaper’s own photojournalists following the action.

Tragedy, take two. One year ago, a school shooting shook Russia, and officials vowed to take action. Now, after another shooting, almost nothing has changed.
This morning in Blagoveshchensk, Russia, a college student brought a shotgun to class, killed a fellow student, wounded three more, and then shot himself. One year earlier, a similar attack shook the eastern Crimean city of Kerch when student Vladislav Roslyakov used a legally purchased firearm to kill 20 people before committing suicide as well. Following the mass shooting in Kerch, Russian government officials proposed a range of legal measures aimed at preventing further tragedies. None of those measures were ultimately implemented.

Five years later, Russia still hasn't recovered from its 2014 economic crisis. These graphs explain why.
Five years ago, Russians realized that their country was sinking into yet another economic crisis. On November 5, 2014, the Central Bank announced that it would no longer underwrite the value of the ruble. That fall, as Russian residents followed their currency’s downward slide with rapt attention, they still didn’t know that this crisis, unlike its predecessors in 1998 and 2008, would stretch on for many years. We’ve used infographics to show why even half a decade hasn’t been enough time for Russia to recover.


‘The Mandalorian’ blasts its way onto the small screen. Disney+ is here, but not (legally) for Russians. ‘Meduza’ looks at the premiere of the service's flagship show.
Disney has finally released the first episode of “The Mandalorian,” a space Western set in the Star Wars universe that’s meant to rope in even more subscribers for the company’s new service, Disney+. Not so long ago, in a galaxy all around us, Netflix was the undisputed king of video on-demand. But turmoil has engulfed the Internet, and streaming services are in dispute. Having clobbered and absorbed its competition at the box office, Disney’s foray into online programming has prompted rampant speculation that Netflix’s days are numbered. “The Mandalorian” is just the opening salvo. The show — and with it Disney's whole new streaming service — is currently unavailable (legally speaking) in most parts of the world, including in Russia. Given past concerns in the United States about “Russian operatives” triggering fan outrage against “The Last Jedi,” Meduza's Kevin Rothrock watched this latest Star Wars installment to find out what all the fuss is about.
